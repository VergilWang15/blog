This is my first days blog post! â˜€

I just add a new feature to my website, which is the comment system using [Giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus)! 

Thanks to [m19v](https://dev.to/m19v)'s step-by-step [tutorial](https://dev.to/m19v/how-to-add-giscus-comments-to-docusaurus-439h)! It's really helpful!

Giscus is a Github App that provides a comment system for your website. It's free (thanks to Github) and easy to use. You can check out the [official website](https://giscus.app/) for more information.
