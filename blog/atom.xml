        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first blog post!</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus v3</a> to build this site, and it's the first time I use a blog site to host my personal dev docs and daily notes. Great start!</p>
<p>Copilot helped me to write some words, he is indeed not so smart while writing articles, but I believe he tried his best(He is a fined turned GPT-3.5 instruction model I guess?). Some of his completion is funny, so I just keep them here.</p>
<p>I am not a native English speaker, the reason why I write this blog in English is a peronal challenge. Maybe one day I will leave China and work overseas. So I just write these words while imagining I am already there üòÇ.</p>
<p>So, let's start! Some blogs for dev notes, some for daily notes, some for life and some for fun. I will try to hold on unless I am done with this as long as I can üòÅ.</p>]]></content>
