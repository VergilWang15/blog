This is my first blog post!

I am using [Docusaurus v3](https://docusaurus.io/) to build this site, and it's the first time I use a blog site to host my personal dev docs and daily notes. Great start!

Copilot helped me to write some words, he is indeed not so smart while writing articles, but I believe he tried his best(He is a fined turned GPT-3.5 instruction model I guess?). Some of his completion is funny, so I just keep them here.

I am not a native English speaker, the reason why I write this blog in English is a peronal challenge. Maybe one day I will leave China and work overseas. So I just write these words while imagining I am already there 😂.

So, let's start! Some blogs for dev notes, some for daily notes, some for life and some for fun. I will try to hold on unless I am done with this as long as I can 😁.
